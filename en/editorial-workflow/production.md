4. [Creating a new Article Version](production.md#versioning)

During the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants who will help prepare the final publication files, known as galleys.

## <a name="orientation"></a>Orientation

The Production stage provides three panels to create files ready for publication. If you have enabled versioning for this journal (Settings > Distribution > Versioning), article versions will be displayed in a tab view. 

### <a name="production-ready"></a>Production Ready Files

All files selected by the editor for production will appear here. These typically include files that have been prepared during the [Copyediting stage](copyediting.md). Production assistants will use these files to generate the final publication formats.

### <a name="production-discussions"></a>Production Discussions

Editors and production assistants can use this panel to initiate conversations, if there are any details that need to be clarified before the final publication files can be created.

### <a name="publication-formats"></a>Galleys

Editors and production assistants can create galleys and upload a file for each galley. These typically represent separate publication formats, such as PDF and HTML.

### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add production assistants or layout editors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow.md#participants).

## <a name="publish"></a>Publishing the Submission

Once you are ready to publish the submission, you must schedule it for publication in an issue.

The **Schedule for Publication** button will allow you to select an forthcoming issue, set a publication date, attach licensing permissions and add page numbers if desired.

## <a name="versioning"></a>Creating a new Article Version

If you have enabled versioning for this journal (Settings > Distribution > Versioning), you can can create a new version of a published article with the **New Version** button. The new article version opens in a new tab and contains the galleys and metadata of the previous version. The new version will not be public right away. You can edit the version by changing the metadata and uploading new galley files and publish the version when finished with the button **Publish this Version**.

### <a name="versioning-tabs"></a>Tab view of Versions

Old versions are displayed in the tab view and can not be edited again.

The button **New Version** is only displayed if the recent version has been published.

The Production Discussions at the bottom of the page are not bound to a specific version.

### <a name="versioning-metadata"></a>Metadata of Versions

The metadata view at the top of the page will always display the metadata of the most recent article version. The metadata of each version can be viewed at the version tab.

### <a name="versioning-frontend"></a>View of Versions at the Article Page

Only the current version of the article is linked at the table of contents of the issue. Old versions of the article are linked at the article page.

Each article version is being displayed at an own article page with the corresponding metadata of the version. Old versions have also an indication and link to the recently published version of the article.

The URL structure of the current article is unchanged (.../article/view/[articleId]) but there is a link with the version number as well (.../article/version/[articleId]/[version]. Old versions can only be accessed via the version URL.
